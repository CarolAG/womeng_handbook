# Monthly Lunch

## Goals
* Create a casual environment for WomEng members to get to know each other in order to strengthen the community.
* Create a trustworthy and supportive WomEng group.

## How it works
Find a weekday that works well for most women engineers and allies within your organization and create a recurring calendar invite with a designated location. Gather and enjoy lunch!
