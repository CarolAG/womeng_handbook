# WomEng Handbook

WomEng is a strong, supportive, and empowering community of women engineers and allies.

At Square, the WomEng community grew from a mailing list to regular, in-person gatherings. Today, WomEng expands outside of Square and includes a large network of women engineers.

We had many conversations and meetings to come up with the recurring events we host today. To help others start and/or expand a WomenEng group in their community, we’re open sourcing a handbook with everything you need to get started.
